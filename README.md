# MLCD-code

The MLCD project (Markup Languages for Complex Documents) is a collaboration
between Claus Huitfeldt of the University of Bergen and Michael Sperberg-McQueen
of Black Mesa Technologies.  At various times others have been involved in our work,
most notably Allen Renear, David Dubin, and Yves Marcoux, but they are not to be
held responsible for what is found here.

The main web site for the MLCD project is http://mlcd.blackmesatech.com/ -- ths
MLCD-code organization on Github is intended to house code and code-like artifacts
produced in the course of the project.  (The name `MLCD` was already taken.)

At the moment, none of the MLCD-code repositories is public; that will change 
eventually.
